A PHP experiment library inspired by Github's own [Scientist](https://github.com/github/scientist).

---

## Introduction

Scientist is an experimentation framework for PHP that will allow you to refactor and improve upon existing code in a live environment, without incurring risk or breakages.

Simply define an experiment, sit back, and let the results flow in.

```php
<?php

// We need a Laboratory to do science.
$experiment = (new Scientist\Laboratory)

    // Define an experiment with a name.
    ->experiment('experiment title')
    
    // Set a callback containing our control code.
    ->control($controlCallback)
    
    // Set a callback containing our trial code.
    ->trial('trial name', $trialCallback);

// Run the experiment, receiving the control return value.
$value = $experiment->run();
```

A [more detailed description](https://scientist.readme.io/docs/introduction), and [full documentation](https://scientist.readme.io/) is available.
